AND Operator:
if:
 x & y == z
then:
 x & z == z   and   y & z == z.
Also, then x and y are called the supermasks.

Question Example: Find if subsequence exist whose & is equal to target.
Approach: Collect all the supermasks in the arraylist. If and of all the supermasks is equal to target then subsequence exists else not.
