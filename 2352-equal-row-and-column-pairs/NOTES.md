Convert all the rows and columns into string and store them in the arraylist.
Run two loops on the arraylists (n^2) and for every equal value increment the count.
Return the value of count.
​
While making them into the string, make sure to add " " space in between number and trim the string before adding into the list.
This will take care of the edge cases like:
arr =
{{11, 1},
{1, 11}}
